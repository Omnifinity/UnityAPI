# UnityAPI #


Official API for use of the Omnideck ODT with the Unity Game Engine.

Requires that the user has access to either A) an Omnideck or B) an Emulator (will be provided soon).    

## NOTE: ##
 
The API is under heavy redesign to cater for HTC Vive support. The OVR support will be deprecated and made available to users once the Oculus Touch becomes available. There is obsolete code so tread with causion.

Also note that the routines are not optimized for speed any way at the moment.
