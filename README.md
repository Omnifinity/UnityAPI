# Omnifinity UnityAPI Beta #


Official API for use of the Omnideck ODT with the Unity Game Engine. HTC Vive Edition.    

## NOTE: ##
 
The API is stable for use with HTC Vive / Steam VR.   

The OVR support is currently unsupported but will be made available to users once the Oculus Touch becomes available.

The OSVR support is coming.

The routines are not optimized for speed but instead clarity at the moment.
