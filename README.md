# Omnifinity UnityAPI Beta #


Official API for use of the Omnideck ODT with the Unity Game Engine. HTC Vive Edition.    

## NOTE: ##
 
The API is under heavy redesign to cater for HTC Vive support. The OVR support is currently unsupported but will be made available to users once the Oculus Touch becomes available.

Note that the routines are not optimized for speed any way at the moment.
